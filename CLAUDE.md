## Project

**Claude Safe-Read Hook**

A Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook that recognizes known-safe, read-only shell
commands and auto-approves them, so routine reads don't interrupt the user with
permission prompts. It decomposes compound Bash commands (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`,
newlines — quote/backtick/`$()`-aware) and allows a segment set only when *every*
segment is a recognized safe read. It also ASKs for confirmation on gated git
writes (`add`/`commit`/`stash`) when the working branch is protected
(`master`/`main`). It is for a single power-user (the author) today; it is now
being shaped into an installable, configurable package published for others to
run via `uvx` (the goal that motivated dropping the stdlib-only rule).

It is **complementary to `dcg`** (`~/.local/bin/dcg`), which remains the
authority for *blocking* dangerous commands. This hook never denies — it only
ALLOWs or ASKs, and otherwise abstains (stays silent, letting the normal
permission flow proceed).

**Core Value:** Auto-approve known-safe read-only commands with zero false-allows — a command
that mutates state must never be silently approved. Coverage is secondary to
that guarantee; when in doubt, abstain.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Python. **Runtime dependencies are now permitted** (changed at Phase 11, 2026-06-06; the earlier "standard library only — no runtime dependencies" rule is **superseded**). The project is becoming a `uvx`-published package. Dep discipline: keep the set small and justified, **pin versions**, **lazy-import any dep on the hot path** (the latency-sensitive decision path), and **abstain-never-crash** on dep errors. TOML config still uses stdlib `tomllib` (Python 3.11+). First runtime dep: `pglast` (libpg_query — real PostgreSQL parser) for the Phase 11 SQL analyzer.
- **Safety**: Conservative-by-default. Any ambiguity → abstain. A false-allow (approving a state-mutating command) is the cardinal failure; favor zero false-allows over broader coverage.
- **Reliability**: The hook must never crash or block Claude's flow; all errors are caught and logged (currently to `/tmp/claude-hook.log`), and the hook abstains on failure. A runtime dep that raises must be caught and abstain, never crash.
- **Performance**: Decision path must remain low-latency since it runs on every Bash invocation; runtime deps lazy-imported off the common read path.
- **Compatibility**: Must keep emitting the Claude Code PreToolUse hook output contract.

## Technology Stack

## The Cardinal Constraint: Runtime vs Dev
> **SUPERSEDED at Phase 11 (2026-06-06):** "stdlib only — no runtime deps" is no longer in force. Runtime deps are permitted (uvx distribution); keep them small/justified/pinned, lazy-import on the hot path, abstain-never-crash on dep errors. First dep: `pglast`. `tomllib` stays stdlib.
| Layer | Contents | Lives in pyproject as |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **Runtime** | Python stdlib + pinned deps (`tomllib` stdlib; `pglast` for SQL) — small, justified, lazy-imported on the hot path | `dependencies = ["pglast", …]` |
| **Dev / CI** | pytest, ruff, a type checker, build backend | `[dependency-groups]` / `[project.optional-dependencies]` |
## Recommended Stack
### Runtime (shipped artifact)
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why |
|------------|---------|---------|-----|
| CPython | `>=3.11` (floor) | Execution | `tomllib` enters stdlib at 3.11. Setting the floor here means TOML config needs zero runtime deps. Local dev/runtime is currently 3.14.4. |
| `tomllib` | stdlib | Parse TOML config (global + per-project) | In-stdlib since 3.11. **Read-only** parser — fine, since config is human-edited, never machine-written by the hook. |
| `re`, `subprocess`, `json`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `traceback`, `datetime` | stdlib | Existing hook machinery | Already used by the 447-line seed; no change. |
### Dev / CI tooling
| Technology | Version (2026-05-30) | Purpose | Why |
|------------|----------------------|---------|-----|
| **pytest** | `9.0.3` | Test framework (splitter, each recognizer, allow/ask/abstain matrix, adversarial false-allow cases) | De-facto standard. Fixtures + `parametrize` are ideal for a recognizer table and a corpus of malicious compound commands. v9 reads native `[tool.pytest]` in pyproject; requires Python `>=3.10` (compatible with our 3.11 floor). |
| **ruff** | `0.15.15` | Linter **and** formatter (one tool) | Replaces black + isort + flake8 + pyupgrade + pydocstyle. Rust-fast, single binary, configured entirely in pyproject `[tool.ruff]`. Industry default in 2026. |
| **pyright** | `1.1.409` | Static type checker | Fast, ~98% typing-spec conformance, already installed on this machine. Good editor integration. Small codebase → cheap to keep green. mypy `2.1.0` is an equally defensible alternative; pick pyright for speed + zero extra install here. |
| **hatchling** | `1.29.0` | PEP 517 build backend | Pure-Python project, no compiled step, no VCS-versioning need, deployment deferred → low-stakes choice. Hatchling is backend-neutral: works with plain `pip install -e .` and `python -m build`, so contributors are **not** forced onto uv. |
| **uv** | `0.11.16` | Dev environment + lockfile + CI installer | Already installed locally. Fast resolver/installer; `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff`, `uv lock`. Used as the *workflow tool*, distinct from the *build backend*. |
| **GitHub Actions** | — | CI: lint + typecheck + test matrix | Standard for a single-maintainer OSS repo; free for public repos. |
### Project layout (src layout)
## How Claude Code hooks are packaged / deployed
- **Exec form (recommended):** `"command": "python3", "args": ["${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/safe_read_hook.py"]`
- **Shell form:** single `command` string with pipes/`&&`; requires manual quoting.
## Rationale Summary (why these, briefly)
- **~~stdlib-only runtime~~ (SUPERSEDED Phase 11)** — runtime deps now permitted (uvx); discipline that survives: small/justified/pinned, lazy-import on hot path, abstain-never-crash. Preserves zero-install deployability and keeps the
- **3.11 floor + tomllib** — the single decision that makes TOML config free of runtime deps.
- **ruff** — collapses 4–5 legacy tools into one fast binary; one `[tool.ruff]` block.
- **pytest** — the table/parametrize model fits a recognizer registry and an adversarial corpus perfectly.
- **pyright** — fast, installed, high conformance; mypy is a fine swap.
- **hatchling + uv** — neutral backend (doesn't lock contributors into uv) plus uv as the fast workflow tool.
- **src layout** — tests hit the installed package, catching packaging bugs the standalone deploy would hit.
## What NOT to Use (and why)
| Avoid | Why not | Use instead |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **`tomli` (PyPI backport) + fallback shim** | Adds a *runtime* dependency, violating the cardinal "stdlib only" rule. The whole point of the 3.11 floor is to avoid this. | `requires-python = ">=3.11"` + stdlib `tomllib`. |
| **Supporting Python < 3.11** | Forces `tomli` or a hand-rolled parser; reintroduces a runtime dep and parser-divergence risk. | Floor at 3.11. |
| **black + isort + flake8 (separate tools)** | Three configs, three installs, slower; superseded. | ruff (lint + format). |
| **Poetry / `poetry-core` backend** | Heavier workflow, non-PEP-621 history, no benefit for a zero-dep pure-Python lib. | hatchling (or uv_build). |
| **`ty` / `pyrefly` as the primary type checker** | Astral `ty` is beta (~53% spec conformance); pyrefly is new. Promising and very fast, but not the safe primary for a *safety-critical* tool in 2026. | pyright (or mypy 2.x); revisit `ty` later. |
| **Runtime deps for *bash* parsing (`bashlex`, `shlex`-heavy rewrites, `pyparsing`)** | The from-scratch bash tokenizer (Phase 4) works and is fast; replacing it risks behavior drift on the security-sensitive path. (Post-Phase-11 the objection is behavior-drift, NOT "deps forbidden" — deps are allowed; SQL/Python DO adopt a real parser like `pglast`.) | Keep the from-scratch bash tokenizer; use real parsers for embedded sublanguages (SQL/Python). |
| **`argparse` / CLI frameworks (click/typer) on the hook path** | The hook's only input is a JSON stdin payload; no CLI surface. Adds deps and startup cost. | Plain `sys.stdin.read()` + `json.loads`. |
| **Async anything** | Single short-lived process per Bash call; async adds overhead and complexity with zero benefit. | Synchronous stdlib. |
| **`setuptools` with `setup.py`** | Legacy boilerplate; no compiled extensions to justify it. | hatchling + declarative pyproject. |

## Open Questions
## Confidence Assessment
| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Versions (ruff 0.15.15, pytest 9.0.3, mypy 2.1.0, hatchling 1.29.0, pyright 1.1.409, uv 0.11.16) | HIGH | Fetched live from PyPI / `uv --version` on 2026-05-30. |
| tomllib floor / no-tomli decision | HIGH | stdlib `tomllib` since 3.11 verified locally; constraint logic is deductive from PROJECT.md. |
| ruff / pytest / src-layout as standard | HIGH | Consistent across official docs and 2026 ecosystem sources. |
| Type-checker choice | MEDIUM-HIGH | pyright recommended; mypy equally valid. ty/pyrefly intentionally excluded as primary. |
| Build backend choice | MEDIUM | hatchling vs uv_build both fine; recommendation is preference, not necessity. |
| Hook deploy / output contract | HIGH for established parts | settings.json `command`+`args`, `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, allow/ask/abstain verified. `"defer"` / new hook types flagged needs-verification. |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
